## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. Before contributing, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/search?q=./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Finding Something to Work On

1.  Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mindfiredigital/ignix-ui/issues) for open issues.
2.  Look for issues you are interested to work on.
3.  If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. This helps prevent duplicate work.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1\. Setup Your Environment

First, get the project set up on your local machine.

  - **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of the [Ignix UI repository](https://github.com/mindfiredigital/ignix-ui) page.

  - **Clone your forked repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ignix-ui.git
    cd ignix-ui
    ```

  - **Install dependencies:** This project uses `pnpm` for package management.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

  - **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

### 2\. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that follows our conventions:

  - For new features: `feature/description-of-feature`
  - For bug fixes: `fix/description-of-fix`

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Example for a new feature
git checkout -b feature/add-new-component

# Example for a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/fix-button-style
```

### 3\. Add a New Component

  - Create the new component file inside `packages/registry/components/`.
  - Ensure you follow the existing folder structure and file conventions used by other components.
  - After creating the component, you must register it. Update the `packages/registry/registry.json` file with the details of your new component.

### 4\. Add Documentation

Documentation is crucial for every component.

  - Create a new documentation file for your component inside the `apps/docs/docs/components/` directory. Use the `.mdx` format (e.g., `new-component.mdx`).
  - Add a link to your new documentation page in the sidebar by updating the `apps/docs/sidebars.ts` file.

### 5\. Write Tests

We require tests for all new features and bug fixes.

  - Add test cases for your component in a file located alongside the component source code.
  - Ensure all tests pass before submitting your changes. Run the tests using:
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```

### 6\. Commit and Push Your Changes

  - Stage your changes for commit.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://gitlab.mindfire.co.in/mindfire-foss/open-source-guidelines/-/blob/main/contribution-guidelines/commit-messages.md) specification.
    ```bash
    # Example for a new feature
    git commit -m "feat: add new awesome component"

    # Example for a bug fix
    git commit -m "fix: resolve style issue in button component"
    ```
  - Push your branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-new-component
    ```

### 7\. Create a Pull Request

  - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".
  - Set the base branch to `development`.
  - Fill out the Pull Request (PR) template with the required information:
      - Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes.
      - Reference any related issues using `#issue-number`.
      - Include screenshots or videos for any UI changes.
  - Click "Create pull request" to submit it for review.

## Code Review Process

  - Once your PR is submitted, the project maintainers will review it.
  - If changes are requested, make the necessary updates on your branch and push them. Your PR will update automatically.
  - Once the PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the `development` branch.
